Controls were implemented:
--------------------------
Mouse control of flashlight (in addition to arrow keys) 
WASD to control camera									
page up/down to move light closer/ferther away
SPACE to change teapot color
Mouse wheel for zooming
Reset (using R) - world, light, post processing effect, mouse cursor

Other optionals we've implemented:
----------------------------------
Time-based light intensity - with ramdomness			
Soft edge light

Post processing effects
-----------------------
0 - No effect
1 - Gaussian blur
2 - Edge detection
3 - Sharping (using Laplacian)
4 - Salt&Pepper noise reduction (median kernel)
5 - A static wave on the screen
6 - Time-based swirl
7 - Time-based glow (screen brightens and then fades)
8 - Shock wave

Post processing optionals we've implemented
-------------------------------------------
Additional post processing - edge, sharp, swirl etc...
Image space pp  - salt&pepper, static wave
Time based pp  - glow, swirl

Running
-------
Pay attention - there are some static configuration in our solution (ex2.vcxproj) such as:
	- OpenCV directories & libs
	- OpenMesh directories & libs
So, change it to your configuration before compiling.

We've attached a python script - run.py and an executable we've compiled statically. 
cmd -> python run.py

Have a nice day :)
