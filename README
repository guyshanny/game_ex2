Controls were implemented:
--------------------------
Mouse control of flashlight (in addition to arrow keys) 
WASD to control camera									
page up/down to move light closer/ferther away
SPACE to change teapot color
Mouse wheel for zooming

Other optionals we've implemented:
----------------------------------
Time-based light intensity - with ramdomness			
Soft edge light

Running
-------
Pay attention - there are some static configuration in our solution (ex2.vcxproj) such as:
	- OpenCV directories & libs
	- OpenMesh directories & libs
So, change it to your configuration before compiling.

We've attached a python script - run.py and an executable we've compiled statically. 
cmd -> python run.py

Have a nice day :)
